## Description

Out of our passion to solve the issue of time waste in the robot creation process, ARC was born. The ARC software platform reduces the time it takes to get from idea to implementation. Since 2011 we have been listening to the challenges robot builders encounter and continue to provide them with an ever expanding toolbox of solutions. Join us on this journey!

We didn't stop at the software, we also made time saving hardware solutions. This Voltmeter reference design is one of them. The Voltmeter connects to an ADC port. An ARC ADC skill can take the analog data and convert it into voltage in order to measure the source voltage of a supply or signal. A unique feature of this design is that it has reverse polarity protection. We want to share these files with you so you can create your own version for your community and customers to enjoy!

**Features:** 
- Multimeter Lead input with Flexible silicone wire
- Reverse polarity protection
- PCB can alternately be used with Banana Jacks
- Green Power LED
- Voltage requirement: 0-17.5VDC input
- Wire Length: 34"
- Dimensions: 26.3(W) x 30.8(L) x 9.2(H) (mm) PCB
- Weight: 58g

**Major components:** 
- D2275 Set of Multimeter probes
- 1N4448W-TP 75V 250mA reverse polarity Diode (low leakage current)

**Manufacturing notes:** 
1. Manufacturer: Single side placement and soldering of SMT components
2. Manufacturer: Single Side soldering of THT components

## ARC Skill

The ARC ADC skils are very easy to use with the Voltmeter. Read or graph the voltage values with the simple click of a mouse button or with code.
